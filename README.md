Launchpad makes it easy to transfer data from one database to another database or CSV. This makes it easy to load datasets into OpenLattice's cloud staging area for cleaning and processing. 

Our configuration driven extract and load makes it easy to setup recurring data integrations using Windows Task Scheduler or cron jobs.
